v0.96
Fix RAM Read benchmark error if SSE4.1 not supported,
cause: SSE4.1 and non-temporal read feature detection bug.

Improve code comments.

v0.98.0
Threads management redesign.
Under debug. 
Multi-Socket NUMA-optimization yet locked at this debug version.

v0.98.1
Non-temporal read optimization for DRAM benchmarks.
Use PREFETCHNTA if MOVNTDQA not supported,
actual for AM2 CPUs.

for simple text window and for drawings speed=f(size).

v0.98.3
Large pages support.

v0.98.4
Add visual number of threads and large page modes
for drawings window, speed=f(size).

v0.98.5
Fix Y-approximation bug at drawings speed=f(size).

v0.99.0
Disable branches with MOVNTDQA/VMOVNTDQA instructions.
Always use PREFETCHNTA non-temporal hint for DRAM read.

v1.00.00
Improve code comments.
Add Vector Brief test.

v1.01.00
Experimental unlock numa-aware support.

v1.01.05
Improve code comments.
Internal changes for support Processor Groups
and platform with above 64 logical processors.
This feature yet locked.
Some code optimization, remove unused performance
patterns.

v1.01.06
Restrict threads affinitization if Hyper-Threading or SMT
supported by platform but not enabled by test option settings.

v1.01.07
Optimize SSE tests code size:
use MOVAPS instead MOVAPD,
use MOVNTPS instead MOVNTPD.

v1.01.08
Update FMA tests:
FMA256 optimizing horizontal additions phase.
FMA512 bug fix and optimizing horizontal additions phase.
Main "hot cycle" not changed.

v1.01.09
Update affinitization restrictions for single thread.
Some code locked, under debug.

v1.01.10
Fix bug: large pages mode flag can be corrupted at
NUMA memory allocation branch.
Some internal optimizations.
Improve comments.

v1.01.11
Fix parameters shadow bug.

v1.01.13
Integrate debug features:
Template debug, Application debug, Window debug.

v1.01.14
Fix NUMA highest node detection bug:
check WinAPI-updated QWORD variable instead DWORD variable.

v1.01.15
Fix wrong input parameter:
Parm#2 = RDX = Pointer to PAINTSTRUCT structure
before WinAPI call:
call [EndPaint]


Generation 2, tagged "experimental".

v1.02.00 - v1.02.24
Redesign.
GUI changes.
Add latency measurement.
Add MMX instructions support.
Add approximation and adaptive modes.

v1.02.25 - v1.02.27
Some optimizations at drawings window GUI.
Some "TODO" fixed.
Other "TODO" moved to separate document, for source readability.

15.06.2019 (v1.02.30)
Add branch for ia32 support.
Change directories names.

20.06.2019 (v1.02.31)
Experimental start ia32 support.

10.07.2019 (v1.02.34 versions for ia32 and x64).
Fix thread routine return bug, terminate thread only after routine return.
Add delays after termination primary measurement threads and
after termination GUI scenario secondary measurement thread:
for primary termination (1), for drawing window exit (2) and resize (3).
3 points with added software-controlled delay.
This bug was detected at ASUS P5KPL-VM with Pentium Dual E2160
as hang when press "Resize" button at drawing window.
