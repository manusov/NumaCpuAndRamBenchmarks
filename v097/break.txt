Остановился на следующих операциях:

1) + Use 8-bit offsets for size optimizing, base point is middle.
2) Multi-thread optimizing, auto-select number of threads.
3) + Use VirtualAlloc instead heaps.
4) + New Print Size function from v0.95 under construction.
5) + DRAM Speed and Cache Speed works from AMD test project: non-temporal read (not write only).
6) See all comments at NCRB sources.
7) See all works NCRB_v095 under construction, directory "old".

8) Use MEDIAN in the statistics, instead averaging.
9) Use variable optimized number of threads.
10) Use x87 FPU when benchmarks calculations, check x87 FPU presence.
11) Improve FASM features usage, example = structures members access by NAME, not numeric OFFSET.
12) For NUMA auto-optimization, pages must be first accessed by NUMA-optimal processor,
    without pre-blank all allocated memory by master thread.
13) RDTSCP optional replace for RDTSC.
14) Asynchronous test run, not a GUI callback.


--- v0.94 in progress ---

1) Changed messages set, remove start warning.
2) Removed Block#3 allocation and address addition, Blocks #1 and #2 used only.
3) Optimize benchmark method selection for non-temporal read support.
4) Allocated memory size changed from 1GB to 2GB:
16 threads * 32 GB * 2 (source + dest ) = 1GB
1GB (single buffer) + 1GB (multi buffers x16, NUMA) = 2GB.
