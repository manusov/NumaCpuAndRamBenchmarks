Остановился на следующих операциях:

1) + Use 8-bit offsets for size optimizing, base point is middle.
2) Multi-thread optimizing, auto-select number of threads.
3) + Use VirtualAlloc instead heaps.
4) + New Print Size function from v0.95 under construction.
5) + DRAM Speed and Cache Speed works from AMD test project: non-temporal read (not write only).
6) See all comments at NCRB sources.
7) See all works NCRB_v095 under construction, directory "old".

--- v0.94 in progress ---

1) Changed messages set, remove start warning.
2) Removed Block#3 allocation and address addition, Blocks #1 and #2 used only.
3) Optimize benchmark method selection for non-temporal read support.
4) Allocated memory size changed from 1GB to 2GB:
16 threads * 32 GB * 2 (source + dest ) = 1GB
1GB (single buffer) + 1GB (multi buffers x16, NUMA) = 2GB.
