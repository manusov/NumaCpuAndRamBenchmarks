1) + First, build simple window for debug.
2) + Reorder data by logic: GUI and Scenario.
3) + Order constants and variables for minimize executable file size.
4) + Divide overflow exception bug, bad precision: use x87 FPU.


1) Simple.
2) SMP, HT, NUMA.
3) Drawings.

1) Use prefetchnta if not supported movntdqa, include copy, include 256-bit. Check.
